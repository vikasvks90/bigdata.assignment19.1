1) Create a customer_hive table on the top of 'customer' table created in the last session.Calculate the maximum and minimum age of customer from the table.

create external table customer_hive
(
id string, name string, location string, age int
)
STORED BY 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HBaseStorageHandler'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ('hbase.columns.mapping' = ':key,details:name,details:location,details:age')
TBLPROPERTIES ('hbase.table.name' = 'customer');

select max(age),min(age) from customer_hive;


2) Access the customer hbase table from pig and compute the maximum and minimum age among all the customers along with their corresponding name and id.

my_data = LOAD 'hbase://customer' USING org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.hbase.HBaseStorage('details:*','-loadKey true') as (id:int,name:chararray,location:chararray,age:int);

result = FOREACH my_data GENERATE id, details#'name', details#'age'
group_result = GROUP result by id;
age_data = FOREACH group_result GENERATE group,MAX(my_data.age),MIN(my_data.age);
dump age_data;

Note: There is some version mismatch in pig nad hbase,raised the ticket for same but could not be resolved so not able to provide screenshot for that
